I want you to find the correlation between the tables and between the columns.
Your role is to return me a list of columns that should be correlated, or equal.
I expect from you a json format that should look like:
[
{
"candidate_feature_combo": ["taille_du_batiment","releve1","releve2"],
"reason_why_it_is_a_candidate": "reason..."
},
...
]
